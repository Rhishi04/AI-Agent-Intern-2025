Given this, I recommend a direct manual check of the dataset for missing or null values in the key columns: Change_Control_ID, TypeOfChange, Creation_Date, Implementation_Date, Status, Authority_Approval_Status, and Dept.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with a manual count and percentage summary of missing values in these columns based on the dataset? This will help identify which columns have the highest incompleteness and potential data quality concerns."
